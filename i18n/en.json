Together with your team you search for answers to questions, such as: How did the issue arise? When does it occur? What makes the issue difficult to solve? What has been done before to solve the issue?",
        "stage1text2": "To understand your target group, fill in an Empathy map with the aim to gain insight on the Pains & Gains. As a start, to gain extra insight, you determine in what form; observing, interviews, focus groups etc, empathic research is carried out. This helps you to overcome your obstacles. For example to achieve the gains (adjustment, efficiency, insight, savings, etc.). All results are captured in the Empathy map.",
        "stage2": "Stage 2",
        "stage2text1": "In this stage you are going to cover the overarching issue. It is advisable to put together a core team and to involve this team directly in all components. Through empathic research you will really understand the target group. This can be done by observing, conducting interviews, forming focus groups, etc. You will empathize with the experiences of different stakeholders.",
        "stage2text2": "Capture the insights in the Define Map and include the extremes of all results in the next stage; generating ideas. Involving the target group in this stage can offer a lot of added value. The \"average\" person gives a good impression of the general impression, but it offers less inspiring insights than the extremes.",
        "stage2text3": "On the other hand, the \"extreme\" or \"extrovert\" insights offer opportunities for creative, tangible ideas. It is good to attach a lot of value to the knowledge of the \"average\" person, but also to look for \"extreme\" sides. Different perspectives will make the process of identifying the issue easier.",
        "stage2text4": "You start by asking yourself whether it concerns a problem, general issue, theme, dilemma or a whole new challenge and capture your observations. Now you can proceed to the next phase.",
        "stage3": "Stage 3",
        "stage3text1": "Now that the empathic research has been completed, you will make an analysis of all obtained insights. You categorize all results; which observations from the Define map fit together? You put the agreements together, to form clusters. This way you gain insight into different themes. If there is a solution to the theme, all individual issues of the cluster should be solved.",
        "stage3text2": "On the basis of these clusters, you develop new, out of the box ideas for the overarching issue. Ask yourself which associations can be thought of outside the context of the question. Try to generate as many solutions as possible, without thinking about limitations. In this stage it is about quantity and not about quality! Looking through these new glasses, many creative, innovative solutions for the original issue arise.",
        "stage3text3": "Capture these insigths in the Ideate map. Write down the individual issues per star point and the theme in the core. Based on this you remember ideas that you take with you in the next phase. This way you get perspective in a clear way!",

        "stage4text1": "In the previous stage you have developed solution directions. Now you going to develep them further. The clusters are converted into tangible ideas and solutions. This way you can determine whether your ideas are promising. This can be done in various forms, for example; developing storyboards, prototypes, writing (user) scenarios, rough sketches or visualisations.",
        "stage4text2": "You consider whether your solutions are profitable, reachable and what you have to do for it. Is the solution achievable? Think realistic, but give every idea a fair chance! Eventually there are a few small ideas that have a good chance of success. You will notice that these small ideas come together and offer opportunities. Capture the solutions and specific concepts in the Prototype map.",
        "stage4text3": "Tip: Testing your solution requires a good preparation. Always describe the added value of your new solution (s) for your target group. Keep prototyping until there is a product or solution that works! This is a continuous process. So in this stage choose the best solution (s), focus on them and continue to the final stage.",

        "stage5text2": "Test these prototypes continuously in a short period of time. Continue to develop and improve the prototypes based on experiences from the end users. In this way your solution becomes better and better and it affects more issues and themes. Finally, you choose the best possible solution and capture them in the Test map. ",
        "stage5text3": "Tip: Be sure to test your prototype with the most important stakeholders and do not just limit yourself to your core team. Involving those who play a role in the implementation can have a successful effect. Yet this is not the only important thing. Other business components also play an important role. For example, the financing and the (internal) communication with regard to your solution.",
